## Overview

The `OrganizeEvent` smart contract allows for the creation and registration of events that are accessible only to users who own a specific NFT. The contract supports multiple events and offers functionality for event registration, event check-ins, and tracking attendees based on NFT ownership.

## Features

- **NFT-Gated Access**: Users can only register for events if they own an NFT from the specified contract address.
- **Event Creation**: Authorized users (event managers) can create events with details like name, venue, description, and dates.
- **Event Registration**: Users can register for events using their NFTs.
- **Event Check-In**: Track user participation and attendance during the event.
- **Library-Based Logic**: Core event actions and error handling are managed using external libraries.
